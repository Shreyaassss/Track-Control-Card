# Track-Control-Card

This repository contains the PCB project documents of On-Track Electronics Control Card, which went on Team Avishkar Hyperloop's pod "7.0". 

The PCB comprises of:
- **Power Circuitry:** Various power converters to step down the regulated input 24V to {Â±15V, 12V, 5V, 3.3V} 
- **ADC/Filter:** Conditioning of control-crucial Hall-Effect current & optical distance sensors signals as well as temperature sensors
- **Processors:** Peripheral circuitry of the two microcontrollers MSP432E401Y MCU and Delfino LAUNCHXL-F28379D, achieving low latency via DSP offloading
